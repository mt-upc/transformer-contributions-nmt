Question No 7 by María Izquierdo Rojo ( H-0252 / 96 )
It is a question of how decisions are taken , that is to say whether this is done on the basis of a vote or of consensus , and whether unanimity is required or some form of qualified majority .
Nepal is very high up and helping this country where needs are very great must also be high up on our list .
This commitment to negotiations between the social partners could initially be reached on four matters , which seem to me essential , as of now . Negotiations must begin .

This is something which the committee as a whole felt strongly about in the resolution on the annual economic report and it is a significant omission that it is not in the resolution to wind up this debate .
It is like the story of Plato and the cave ; it is the signifier , not the signified .
The Committee on Transport would therefore have been well advised to devote rather more attention to that committee 's proposals , which were adopted with the strong backing of the PPE Group and the support of the socialist Members .
In ten years , our dependence on fish imports has increased by 30 % ; and the processing industry depends almost entirely on imported fish .

This means that terrestrial frequencies may face new competition in a form over which Europeans no longer have any influence .
What I am saying is that we agree with the House on the need for action .
Thank you very much , Mr Bangemann .
This sort of ungentlemanly conduct is not acceptable .
It does not solve the employment problem if the most we can do is offer firms new profit margins , which provides no guarantee of employment , and also damages the environment and social security .
It is all very well to have common minimum rules on the employment of children , but my wife and I do not need an EU directive to decide whether our son should deliver newspapers .
So it is also necessary to establish very quickly whether the international presence in Bosnia , so fundamental to any reconstruction effort , is to continue .
I am grateful to the President-in-Office for his answer . However , I am sorry to have to say that the results of the Di Roberto mission fall short of our expectations .
Therefore there is a need for a European directive .
The procedure followed : complaints declared admissible and prima facie founded are communicated to the institution or body in question , which is asked to give a first opinion .

Her supporters know that by gathering together they are defying the ruling junta .
The military authorities are still playing too great a part in the social and political life of that nation .

Nevertheless , the rejection of consumptive embryo research - and on this point we are agreed - requires consistency .
No such decision has as yet been taken .
The scheme was to be set up this autumn and the aid paid direct to women 's networks by the Commission .
I therefore congratulate the European Parliament for having organized this debate , and would end by thanking you for inviting the Commission to take part in it .
How can one remain independent or claim to be combating corruption if , at the same time , one is in receipt of largesse , obviously with strings attached ?
Citizens have a better grasp of their rights and obligations .
And the Dublin European Council will reconfirm 1 January , 1999 as the beginning of the Third Stage of EMU .
In my view that reinforces the argument that one should not believe that EMU will automatically mean jobs .
The first one is in relation to the Helms-Burton legislation and our relations with the United States .
If you look at Parliament 's diary for 1997 , you will find that 8 and 15 September are actually Sundays and week-ending days , not week-beginning days .
Meier recommendation for second reading
Recently a German Council official told me that his Brussels office might as well be in Bonn , as his main point of reference was the German Foreign Ministry .

The IGC must amend the Treaty so that it includes the fundamental right of equality between the sexes , but yet more is needed .
Some are unnecessary because they are already covered while others are not acceptable because they would mean changing existing law .

I hope it will spread around here .

The fact of the matter is that in this century , 190 million people have been killed in wars , 60 million of those in Europe .
The debate on the state of the European Union is closed .
But that unfortunately has become a tradition !

At the start of 1996 , there were 21 392 .
There is no hesitation in talking about ' reserves which are contrary to the principles of budgetary orthodoxy ' .

Culture is being exterminated .
If there is no conclusive decision from the government , cereal production will deteriorate further in 1997 and 1998 .
Mr President , I agree with the previous speaker ; unfortunately it is easy to see in the case of Belarus what the legacy of the Soviet Union still means today .
Would it not be more correct , legally speaking , to place the measures under the third pillar and act at an intergovernmental level ?
I therefore call again on the Commission to start and close negotiations in good time in future so that the proper consultation procedure can be concluded and a legal base adopted before payments are made .
The industry was expecting that .
This is a hypocritical budget heading , given the environmental damage that we cause in our own countries .
It may be that media interest in AIDS in the developing countries has declined , but in any event it is not a major subject of public debate at the moment .
I think that that is the very great merit of Mrs McNally 's position and I must therefore congratulate her on her report .

We shall seek to promote greater cohesion between the regions via improvement of the transfer of know-how on aspects of energy-saving strategy from regions with a developed energy efficiency dynamic to regions which are significantly behind in that respect .
I now come to the statement of assurance .
I am happy to inform you today that I was able to present a first report to Ecofin yesterday .
Both of these considerations have to be taken into account in our decision concerning the legal imposition of compulsory quotas of European productions in television broadcasts .
It is currently a matter of regret to us that the Hautala report has not provided the opportunity for real coordination of Community policies on competition , industrial policy , trade and the internal market .
It appears from contacts with the Commission that this is a problem in cross-border traffic in other Member States , too .
This is a view we do not in any way share .
Let me start by restating our determination that the European Union should play its part in this process , as indeed it is already doing through substantial economic and financial aid .
A minimum with exceptions is not a minimum .
But perhaps the Commission could also answer the question , or else it could do something very simple .

Under the guise of harmonization , you will destroy social security .
I should now like to refer to a second , completely different issue .
It would cost ÖS 702 billion for the CCEE to comply with the EU water directive alone .
Thank you , Commissioner .
At the same time , I am disappointed that none of the legally binding agreements which have been made within the framework of interstate cooperation have yet come into force .
The negotiations for an agreement on trade and cooperation between the European Union and South Africa are between those countries and not between the European Union and southern Africa .
Does this mean that , at the Dublin Summit , the UK will be the only Member State not to have pilot action programmes for the Local and Regional Territorial Pacts for Employment ?

It is necessary , therefore , to provide a specific policy for the wetlands , based on their geographical areas .
In principle , we agreed with Mrs Lindeperg 's motion for a resolution and its criticism of the inadequacies in the area of the third pillar .
I am a holder of what is called the orange badge in the United Kingdom , and that will be affected by any changes that would be made as a result of this recommendation coming into being .
Approval of the Minutes
I must say it was unfortunate that she chose my report about which to make it .
If we accept that work makes an essential contribution to people 's prosperity and wellbeing , the same certainly holds good for disabled people too .
I have said it before and I say it again , we know who was poisoning the whole of Europe .
In this case the compensation exceeds the share of the budget allocated to Spain , resulting in a reduction in the compensation payments for all Spanish producers in the 1997 harvest .
Do not forget , ladies and gentlemen , do not forget that the essence of a democracy is not that what the majority says , goes .

Madam President , I also wish to express my best wishes to the Dutch presidency .
In short , we need to ensure that the information society offers equal opportunities and mutual benefits to all .

Mr President , first I want to express my appreciation of the fine resolution in this annual debate on racism and xenophobia .
First of all , the fact that we should not and cannot deal with or look upon terrorist acts as something requiring exceptional procedures or legislation .
The Reding report is therefore both timely and important .
It is a mistake to assume that effectiveness is the same as supranationality .
At least we are making a start with implementing the noble aims set out in the Energy Charter .
There may be a simple explanation , and this may be due to a little slip-up or mistake in the administration .
There is just one more point I should like to make about this whole situation .
We believe that this situation must be reversed , and that social cohesion has to be our prime concern .
I must inform you that for technical reasons it was not possible to translate , print and distribute all of the amendments to this report in all languages .
For the sake , of course , of the unbridled pursuit of profit of monetarism and high finance .
I shall therefore concentrate on the part played by the Commission in this affair .
I should like to end by adapting a traditional saying : ' Friends of Plato , but friends of the truth even more ' .
The report recognizes the amount of money spent on research .
Nor do we want witch-hunts or soundbite sensationalism when we are assigning blame .
I should like to know how the Commission intends to shoulder this responsibility .
Regarding infringements , I just mentioned one case vis-à-vis one Member State .
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive reply .
Question No 60 by Hubert Pirker ( H-0036 / 97 )
The Commissioner seems at a complete loss having received the report of the agency which the Commission itself commissioned .
It is a question of how determined we are to regulate in order to create the modes of transport we wish to see .
I would also like to thank the Committee on Budgets which sent a letter with their comments on the report .
There the similarity between me and Mr Bangemann probably ends .
I should just like to ask Commissioner Fischler one question : how long is the transition phase ?
Why did Mr Delors not come forward to protect and defend the Commission ?

It requires clearly defined marking , and not least it requires information as to what the markings mean .
I hope to have answered all the questions .
Both sides are waging the political struggle remorselessly and it has been going on for years now .
European-level regulation of mortgage credit would therefore mean approximating the security and application rules at the same time , hence ultimately the EU-wide harmonization of national property law provisions .
I regret that , but , as you all know , the deadline of 1 January next year is putting pressure on us all .
If we require it to bear the additional burden of the social policy , we will be hounding more and more jobs out of Europe .
We considered whether we should go on waiting for the Directive , which is impossible in view of the date and the legal basis we are creating for national regulations , or whether we should accept a compromise .
It is sensible to strengthen consumer rights and interests in the area of financial services , banks and insurance services for example .
This issue is so grave that it is hard to understand how something like this could have happened in the European Union .
Chad
Finally , the Commission has also exerted pressure to have a clause inserted in the Treaty , at the Intergovernmental Conference , prohibiting any form of racial discrimination .
We should also pay increasing attention - just as the rapporteur properly pointed out - to the interrelation between short , medium and long term types of aid , through a duly coherent approach .
In fact , the Official Journal has already published the Commission 's regulation on the certificates that importers must hand over to the Community 's customs authorities before furs can be imported .

After all the attention given to the electronic highway , the focusing of attention on the social aspects brought a breathing space .
It is not true , ladies and gentlemen , because there are no obsolete industries ; there are obsolete technologies .

Information technology is only a support .
What is the Commission doing to utilize Phare programme funds more efficiently in the important preparatory stage ?
Question No 22 by Mr Gallagher ( H-0181 / 97 )
Thousands of kilometres away the fraudster is able to hoodwink the system , and this has been happening .
The work done by the Committee of Inquiry , which sheds so much light on the situation and provides strong political impetus , will be of great help when it comes to translating these initiatives into action .
I believe we can help the population more effectively in that way than by merely appearing as firefighters whenever there is a crisis .
Those agreements are a source of employment for a very large number of structurally sensitive maritime regions .

I cannot vote in favour of this resolution because of the paragraphs on reinforced co-operation .
I could in fact have cut you off pursuant to Rule 47 , Mr Pirker , because you were not speaking on the subject , but engaging in a discussion of principle .
Now , the matter of women and the problematical situation of women in Afghanistan .
Now , three points related to this subject : a number of measures have been taken in connection with the specific subject of trade in human beings for the purposes of sexual exploitation .
1997 is a year of major steps towards nuclear disarmament .
Today , we are disappointed .
And yet GMOs are not the panacea of agricultural development !
Therefore I do not think that a number of you have been completely accurate today when you state that we did not take account of the fact that many Member States were against the recommendation to approve this maize .
And it is not very polite to interrupt a colleague while he is speaking .
The notion of Community financial assistance - that is the Treaty 's expression - does not , indeed , exclude genuine budgetary interventions .
I must stress that for this process to be successful it must be inclusive .
Masses and dimensions of motor vehicles
Next , there is the underspend of the appropriations : some 20 % for the structural funds and 24 % for the European social fund , in particular .
I think that the report is excellent and it is good that three individual issues have been raised as tangible examples so that everyone may understand what this is about .
It is not easy in the Commission but you know as well as I do that it will not be easy in Parliament either .
That applies more particularly today , at a time when a gradual increase in tensions and difficulties is threatening to sweep us off course .
The Commissioner was correct when he said that the crisis is political .
The Irish presidency presented a compromise text on this at the Council meeting of December last .
That broke the partnership , and the result of the broken partnership lies before you : a boring auto-oil concept that leads nowhere .

The committee supports the principle of today 's working party with regard to future maritime systems and strongly urges that this be extended to the fifth framework programme as well .
We know that driftnet fishing is unacceptable in the way that the catch of dolphins and turtles etc. is not to be recommended .
That speech may have been written yesterday , I do not know ; but it seems to me as if we are being treated as a rubber stamp .
The Green Paper addresses only the aspect of unauthorized reception of encrypted services .
Our aim should therefore be to ensure that organic feeds are in fact used exclusively , with a suitable transition period .
It is a shame that it has taken so long to appear but , as they say , ' better late than never ' .
For example , not enough attention has been paid to the EU 's northern dimension .
At the same time , Regulation No 2078 of 1992 on environmentally compatible agricultural production methods adapted to the landscape has also contributed substantially to this trend .
It will be possible to wage information society wars by means of the networks .
I am going to be asking you to be very dynamic and very cooperative .
These difficulties were all identified years ago but there seems there has been no way of solving them so far .
That is racism .
Mr President , the two reports which have been discussed here this morning should set alarm bells ringing for most European citizens .

Shortly after this meeting , Mr Kabila announced that the capital , Kinshasa , would be taken by force if President Mobutu did not resign within a week .
But even the safest power station is manned by people .
This objective unfortunately does not exert sufficient pressure to give priority to developing renewable sources of energy .
This has to be said quite plainly here .
This is highlighted by the ongoing concern in relation to the safety of nuclear installations , including Sellafield , to which many people have referred during the earlier debate .
I am , therefore , against nuclear power practised in this way without any nuance .
Lastly , we are angered by the provocative stance of the Sudanese government vis à vis the repeated warnings by the international community , and in particular Security Council Resolution 1070 of 16 August 1996 .
He has already spent 28 months in prison under very unpleasant conditions , with serious consequences for his physical and mental health .
Whereas solar energy could be a solution in one region it is less viable in another , where perhaps water power or bio- energy would be more appropriate .
And what do we have here ?
We in the Committee on Budgets consider that this would be impossible to implement and would set an unacceptable precedent .
Our citizens are demanding rights .
Certainly this was a programme which brought great benefits in its day but these loans are less relevant now than they were .
Secondly , the Eurodac System is about the possibility of taking fingerprints in the case of asylum-seekers and has to do with the implementation of the Dublin Convention .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Parliament finds the proposal which is before us today to be very positive , Commissioner .
Let me conclude by asking the Commissioner to tell us a little more in his address about other measures he is prepared to propose with the aim of further increasing safety on ferries .
Mr President , my report also concerns agriculture , bee-keeping to be precise .
In fact I describe it to my constituents as the complaints department of the Parliament .
