we do not believe that we should cherry-pick .
but this is not what happens .
of course , if a drug addict becomes a pusher , then it is right and necessary that he should pay and answer before the law also .
commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to begin by thanking mr burtone for his report .
' legal drugs ' ( tranquillizers ) finding their way on to an illegal market , especially when used in combination with alcohol , are a major and serious problem particularly for young people .
i should like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to mr titley .
it was a very difficult position and i therefore am delighted about the new agreement .
we must accept that , in the realm of blood and plasma collection , the systems vary and operate on mixed bases .
the minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed .
to this end the oostlander report takes substantial note of the european commission guidelines which are very clear , very precise and do not leave room for subjective interpretation .
europe should not get over ambitious by trying to manage public health policy .
in any event , the national front demands that the peoples of europe should be directly consulted in a referendum to decide on the approval or rejection of maastricht ii .
the authors of the report consider that enlargement to the east is undoubtedly possible in theory , but will be far more difficult in practice .
i would ask you , members of the european parliament present here , to support this amendment by mrs stenius-kaukonen which all members of the finnish parliament across party boundaries support .
they are silting up .
france was the first to take diplomatic and humanitarian action .
i constantly bring this matter up both in writing to the president and to the heads of the political groups .
question no 7 by maría izquierdo rojo ( h-0252 / 96 )
it is a question of how decisions are taken , that is to say whether this is done on the basis of a vote or of consensus , and whether unanimity is required or some form of qualified majority .
nepal is very high up and helping this country where needs are very great must also be high up on our list .
this commitment to negotiations between the social partners could initially be reached on four matters , which seem to me essential , as of now . negotiations must begin .
the committee on transport and tourism has adopted four amendments for the second reading .
they will certainly enhance the feeling of the right of movement by eu citizens and they will also certainly benefit disabled drivers .
the initial commission proposal was adopted unamended by parliament on first reading .
europe in particular has to remain a leading player if it is to safeguard its international competitiveness , not only in terms of economic performance but also in the exploitation and widespread application of new forms of technology .
the absence of harmonized rules governing intellectual property is not unique to europe .
we are giving a clear political signal to the moroccan authorities to continue along the road towards liberalization , political as well as economic .
both demand a credible and active policy to reduce co2 emissions through a combination of incentive , regulation and progressive taxation .
this is something which the committee as a whole felt strongly about in the resolution on the annual economic report and it is a significant omission that it is not in the resolution to wind up this debate .
it is like the story of plato and the cave ; it is the signifier , not the signified .
the committee on transport would therefore have been well advised to devote rather more attention to that committee 's proposals , which were adopted with the strong backing of the ppe group and the support of the socialist members .
in ten years , our dependence on fish imports has increased by 30 % ; and the processing industry depends almost entirely on imported fish .
i hope we can look at and address properly the issue of quota hoppers .
the commission heeded this call .
subject : tendering procedures for mobile phone licences
this means that terrestrial frequencies may face new competition in a form over which europeans no longer have any influence .
what i am saying is that we agree with the house on the need for action .
thank you very much , mr bangemann .
this sort of ungentlemanly conduct is not acceptable .
it does not solve the employment problem if the most we can do is offer firms new profit margins , which provides no guarantee of employment , and also damages the environment and social security .
it is all very well to have common minimum rules on the employment of children , but my wife and i do not need an eu directive to decide whether our son should deliver newspapers .
so it is also necessary to establish very quickly whether the international presence in bosnia , so fundamental to any reconstruction effort , is to continue .
i am grateful to the president-in-office for his answer . however , i am sorry to have to say that the results of the di roberto mission fall short of our expectations .
therefore there is a need for a european directive .
the procedure followed : complaints declared admissible and prima facie founded are communicated to the institution or body in question , which is asked to give a first opinion .
the work of the european ombudsman and the petitions committee is complementary .
the annual activity report clearly states how the ombudsman 's office works and what citizens should do if they want to take matters to the ombudsman for consideration .
her supporters know that by gathering together they are defying the ruling junta .
the military authorities are still playing too great a part in the social and political life of that nation .
the report clearly defines which beverages may be bottled in sparkling wine bottles .
because crémant , which has acquired its patent of nobility here , is not an issue just for one region but for the european union , too .
since we took the initiative of tabling the oral question there has been some progress .
but our first concern is to preserve fish stocks , and especially herring stocks .
the commission , for its part , will continue to play an active part in the intergovernmental conference .
let me say to mrs green and the other members that it is not true that the conciliation agreement with the european parliament on the infrastructure projects was unilaterally changed at florence .
another problem the molitor group does not sufficiently deal with is implementation .
the same difficulty applies , mutatis mutandis as far as the european parliament is concerned .
the resolution submitted by our committee on women 's rights deserves the support of the european parliament , the commission and the council .
my answer - and i hope parliament 's too - will be a directive aimed at introducing a statutory right to interest for firms paid unwarrantably late .
it is an especial problem for our 17 million small and medium-sized enterprises .
it is local authorities and large organization , quangos and national governments which are by and large responsible for a very high proportion of that .
madam president , the european council in florence gave the impression of enormous confusion where the problems of employment are concerned .
i took it over at the beginning of this parliament , a lot of the work on it having already been done by a colleague of mine , claude delcroix .
representatives of all sectors of industry have indicated , at a public hearing , that they see huge problems with the commission proposals .
firstly , in drawing up any new proposal , the council and the commission must take account of the views of the trade unions .
are there any other comments ?
we therefore wish to see clear wording here as well .
nevertheless , the rejection of consumptive embryo research - and on this point we are agreed - requires consistency .
no such decision has as yet been taken .
the scheme was to be set up this autumn and the aid paid direct to women 's networks by the commission .
i therefore congratulate the european parliament for having organized this debate , and would end by thanking you for inviting the commission to take part in it .
how can one remain independent or claim to be combating corruption if , at the same time , one is in receipt of largesse , obviously with strings attached ?
citizens have a better grasp of their rights and obligations .
and the dublin european council will reconfirm 1 january , 1999 as the beginning of the third stage of emu .
in my view that reinforces the argument that one should not believe that emu will automatically mean jobs .
the first one is in relation to the helms-burton legislation and our relations with the united states .
if you look at parliament 's diary for 1997 , you will find that 8 and 15 september are actually sundays and week-ending days , not week-beginning days .
meier recommendation for second reading
recently a german council official told me that his brussels office might as well be in bonn , as his main point of reference was the german foreign ministry .
we refer to this in paragraph 4 of our resolution , the fourth indent , where we specifically state that the current approach is based on wishful thinking .
a major part of this work will be ensuring greater economic policy coordination between all 15 member states .
this would cut down a great deal on abductions .
traditionally , responsibility for decisions on custody has rested with national authorities .
of course there is a difference .
at the same time , i cannot approve of terrorist acts in any form .
the volume of production in the sheepmeat sector is only 10 to 15 % of that in the beef and veal sector .
this is the whole point !
the necessary correction will be made .
madam president , our main concern through this report and through this vote was , once more , to make it clear to the commission that we will not accept further cuts in spending on development .
but yesterday 's papers said that heineken had not in fact pulled out .
the repatriation operations are progressing smoothly .
israel also points the way in the production of educational software .
at the same time , it contributes to a reduction in the amount of beef produced .
i thus look forward eagerly to the commission 's communication and i should like to start this debate afresh with a number of questions .
i know that it is not easy , or something that can be achieved by tomorrow morning . speaking for myself , i simply want us to be able to conduct our deliberations on a more reliable basis .
the commission has not even got as far as submitting a proposal .
we do not need a central office for the whole of europe which centrally compiles all the offences that have to be entered in the record of penalty points !
but i would like to know what percentage of all customs officials in those countries are trained to operate this kind of system .
how is it possible for the commission to extend the transit system to other eastern countries before a system in collapse has been completely reformed in order to curb fraud ?
we believe that the resources should be increased in line with the problems and needs of our country and that measures must be put in place to speed up the absorption of funding and to monitor its use .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
finally , paragraph 93 states that the extreme right-wing parties advocate xenophobia .
asking for asylum is not a crime , and should not be treated as such .
( rapporteur : mr van der waal ) .
there is a need for continuity in decisions of the kind we have already taken here in the house on telecommunications infrastructure .
we need detailed , concrete proposals .
unfortunately , at this stage the running is being made by american companies and we are much slower in catching up on development of this software .
consequently , as my report says , this is what we must do .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
the igc must amend the treaty so that it includes the fundamental right of equality between the sexes , but yet more is needed .
some are unnecessary because they are already covered while others are not acceptable because they would mean changing existing law .
we must face up to the fact that we are talking about a redistribution of income and face what that involves .
the banning of overtime will deprive blue-collar workers of additional earnings , and they will not be able to make ends meet with their basic pay alone .
in the case of these substances , applications are made for the community to fix maximum residue limits , as provided for in council regulation 2377 / 90 .
i hope it will spread around here .
at present , all radioactive waste on the peninsula is kept in medium-term storage facilities either on land or on board ships .
i would , therefore , like to conclude by saying that the commission is being asked to do things , and to mention five things that we are doing or that we will do .
on the other hand , knowledge , instant communications and mobility will be the characteristics of the twenty-first-century economy .
they do not understand why europe exists in theory but not in reality .
the fact of the matter is that in this century , 190 million people have been killed in wars , 60 million of those in europe .
the debate on the state of the european union is closed .
but that unfortunately has become a tradition !
telecommunications services ' whereas we are in fact talking about the linking of the facilities of organizations providing telecom services , which is the wording of the original version and which we would prefer .
i consider the establishment of a european mark that indicates conformity with european standards as an appropriate tool of quality policy that can contribute to improving our competitive position .
are the controls able to be exercised properly and to what extent are they actually effective ?
that is something our citizens can understand .
so , congratulations to the organizers and to the european community mission .
this may have been thanks to the sensible approach of the leading parties or to the absence of the other ethnic group , but it was certainly also thanks to the presence of i-for .
they were deliberately processed so slowly by the serbs that many of them were unable to vote .
a. even in a highly liberalized market , works of art constitute an exception .
surely not .
we believe there is no way that alcohol consumption can be described as ' beneficial in moderation ' .
we have some of the finest dairy and beef herds but we also know everything about bse , which has hit us more than other areas .
madam president , i will make my contribution as brief as possible to make it easier for us to deal with the entire agenda .
madam president , surely we must take things seriously !
i shall therefore now also give the floor to mr dell ' alba once again on a point of order .
the common position does indeed incorporate many of the amendments proposed by parliament at first reading .
i think that i echo the whole house in wishing you , on behalf of all our colleagues , all the very best for your political career in your home country , austria . you have our warmest wishes .
let us think back to the television without frontiers directive , parliament 's first reading of which was completely ignored , because the commission preferred to take the council 's side .
for example , we were to maintain an open and transparent dialogue which would be accessible to the man in the street , an agreement which was defined in greater detail in the declaration of 25 october 1993 .
at the start of 1996 , there were 21 392 .
there is no hesitation in talking about ' reserves which are contrary to the principles of budgetary orthodoxy ' .
the next item is question time to the commission ( b4-0971 / 96 )
it highlights in particular the advantages offered by short-sea shipping in the baltic as a means of access to scandinavia and to the cis .
whilst i support everything that my colleague , ms morgan has said , it is a wider issue than that .
if research has been carried out by several people or institutions in various different countries , it could be almost impossible to obtain consent .
the second point relates to a suitable budgetary allocation , as opposed to that proposed by the council , which is totally inadequate and unacceptable .
with its proposal , the commission is well on the way to undermining the whole point of the e number system .
but i must also remind you that i have received six motions for resolutions to close this debate .
the world poverty summit in copenhagen last year set us all the ambitious aim of eliminating absolute poverty world-wide .
i doubt whether the countries in question will vote for the proposal at the intergovernmental conference .
the danish social democrats have voted in favour of the proposal to amend the list of extraction solvents , since the change does not affect the level of protection in denmark .
we call on it for a burst of courage .
i had asked about the development of the single european market , in which three of the four freedoms are a danger , in my belief , to children .
we must therefore ensure that we conduct a policy in member states which makes young people and others say no to narcotics .
it concerns the approximation not just of type approval but also of technical tests and integrating them on a european basis .
this initiative appears totally inopportune in a context of budget austerity .
it is true that to accept the challenge would have had the effect of endangering the interinstitutional agreement and starting a budget dispute .
culture is being exterminated .
if there is no conclusive decision from the government , cereal production will deteriorate further in 1997 and 1998 .
mr president , i agree with the previous speaker ; unfortunately it is easy to see in the case of belarus what the legacy of the soviet union still means today .
would it not be more correct , legally speaking , to place the measures under the third pillar and act at an intergovernmental level ?
i therefore call again on the commission to start and close negotiations in good time in future so that the proper consultation procedure can be concluded and a legal base adopted before payments are made .
the industry was expecting that .
this is a hypocritical budget heading , given the environmental damage that we cause in our own countries .
it may be that media interest in aids in the developing countries has declined , but in any event it is not a major subject of public debate at the moment .
i think that that is the very great merit of mrs mcnally 's position and i must therefore congratulate her on her report .
in a nutshell , we believe it is right to be concerned about this issue , but this is the wrong legislation .
we shall seek to promote greater cohesion between the regions via improvement of the transfer of know-how on aspects of energy-saving strategy from regions with a developed energy efficiency dynamic to regions which are significantly behind in that respect .
i now come to the statement of assurance .
i am happy to inform you today that i was able to present a first report to ecofin yesterday .
both of these considerations have to be taken into account in our decision concerning the legal imposition of compulsory quotas of european productions in television broadcasts .
it is currently a matter of regret to us that the hautala report has not provided the opportunity for real coordination of community policies on competition , industrial policy , trade and the internal market .
it appears from contacts with the commission that this is a problem in cross-border traffic in other member states , too .
this is a view we do not in any way share .
let me start by restating our determination that the european union should play its part in this process , as indeed it is already doing through substantial economic and financial aid .
a minimum with exceptions is not a minimum .
but perhaps the commission could also answer the question , or else it could do something very simple .
i hope , therefore , that there will be some further attention to procedures so that we can be accountable .
parliament has adopted amendments which define nuclear technology as unsustainable , and here we all need to clarify what we mean with regard to sustainability and the nuclear issue .
it is vital for both farmers and the industry for the commission to introduce a specific support system for non-food crops and to that end i call for a separate system of support for these crops .
the joint debate is closed .
in order to makes fisheries relations clearer and simpler , in 1995 the commission received a mandate to negotiate new framework agreements with the baltic republics to replace all existing fisheries agreements .
it is calculated that no duty is currently paid on 80 % of imported flowers .
i nevertheless , as a realist , acknowledge that it is a fact .
i also wanted to say that a few minutes ago parliament received a petition signed by the largest number of people ever .
this plan will , of course , be adapted according to new developments in the region but the basic assumptions will , however , remain relevant .
one aspect will be that we ensure proper trials for those guilty of genocide .
a council working group has been examining the two proposals and on 11 november ecofin noted that substantial progress had been made , particularly on the article 235 proposal .
even today , the gap between the highest and lowest deficits among the eu states has become significantly narrower , and that trend must continue .
and finally , the most dramatic tragedy of all is that the market is global but the single currency will only be european .
finally , commissioner , and my concluding remarks are addressed particularly to you , obviously we would not want this own-initiative report to be just one more document on your table .
the criteria vary and the member states consider that they are carried out by certain official services alone .
this assertion seems incorrect .
living out an example is the most effective method of prevention .
under the guise of harmonization , you will destroy social security .
i should now like to refer to a second , completely different issue .
it would cost ös 702 billion for the ccee to comply with the eu water directive alone .
thank you , commissioner .
at the same time , i am disappointed that none of the legally binding agreements which have been made within the framework of interstate cooperation have yet come into force .
the negotiations for an agreement on trade and cooperation between the european union and south africa are between those countries and not between the european union and southern africa .
does this mean that , at the dublin summit , the uk will be the only member state not to have pilot action programmes for the local and regional territorial pacts for employment ?
madam president , commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , this is the second reading of the electricity directive , which is designed to create an internal market in electricity .
we will be supporting only these amendments , not the others , because we want the single electricity market to begin operation as soon as possible .
according to the case law of the european court of justice , a directive which has been adopted but not transposed is an adequate legal basis for claims by third parties .
complaints have already been made , in france , mr cot , as you know .
mr president , i tried to revert to the minutes before you moved on .
we are not opposed to this provided that the word definitive is not interpreted as ' standardised ' .
human rights throughout the world in 1995-1996
because only in that way will it be possible to bring an end to the brutal and abhorrent exploitation of the young .
we are calling for all these facts to be taken into consideration and for the case to be re-examined .
so i read that newspaper , and i think there are many newspapers that would not have the confidence to attack their government the way globus does .
we have no complaints about you , quite the opposite , you have shown courage and insight in recent months .
of course international intervention was an absolute must , an obligation , and we did not do what was necessary .
it is necessary , therefore , to provide a specific policy for the wetlands , based on their geographical areas .
in principle , we agreed with mrs lindeperg 's motion for a resolution and its criticism of the inadequacies in the area of the third pillar .
i am a holder of what is called the orange badge in the united kingdom , and that will be affected by any changes that would be made as a result of this recommendation coming into being .
approval of the minutes
i must say it was unfortunate that she chose my report about which to make it .
if we accept that work makes an essential contribution to people 's prosperity and wellbeing , the same certainly holds good for disabled people too .
i have said it before and i say it again , we know who was poisoning the whole of europe .
in this case the compensation exceeds the share of the budget allocated to spain , resulting in a reduction in the compensation payments for all spanish producers in the 1997 harvest .
do not forget , ladies and gentlemen , do not forget that the essence of a democracy is not that what the majority says , goes .
i believe this message must be heeded .
i would also ask you to bear in mind the fact that no objections were made concerning this vote when the minutes were submitted for approval on the following day .
madam president , i also wish to express my best wishes to the dutch presidency .
in short , we need to ensure that the information society offers equal opportunities and mutual benefits to all .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m .
we could , of course , have shown greater courage for co-determination and not for reduced participation , precisely because we were not under pressure of time .
i urge that we keep national traditions but at the same time advance democracy in the world of work at the european level .
the commission wanted to include the budgetary provisions in the proposals .
mr president , first i want to express my appreciation of the fine resolution in this annual debate on racism and xenophobia .
first of all , the fact that we should not and cannot deal with or look upon terrorist acts as something requiring exceptional procedures or legislation .
the reding report is therefore both timely and important .
it is a mistake to assume that effectiveness is the same as supranationality .
at least we are making a start with implementing the noble aims set out in the energy charter .
there may be a simple explanation , and this may be due to a little slip-up or mistake in the administration .
there is just one more point i should like to make about this whole situation .
we believe that this situation must be reversed , and that social cohesion has to be our prime concern .
i must inform you that for technical reasons it was not possible to translate , print and distribute all of the amendments to this report in all languages .
for the sake , of course , of the unbridled pursuit of profit of monetarism and high finance .
i shall therefore concentrate on the part played by the commission in this affair .
i should like to end by adapting a traditional saying : ' friends of plato , but friends of the truth even more ' .
the report recognizes the amount of money spent on research .
nor do we want witch-hunts or soundbite sensationalism when we are assigning blame .
i should like to know how the commission intends to shoulder this responsibility .
regarding infringements , i just mentioned one case vis-à-vis one member state .
i would like to thank the commissioner for his comprehensive reply .
question no 60 by hubert pirker ( h-0036 / 97 )
the commissioner seems at a complete loss having received the report of the agency which the commission itself commissioned .
it is a question of how determined we are to regulate in order to create the modes of transport we wish to see .
i would also like to thank the committee on budgets which sent a letter with their comments on the report .
there the similarity between me and mr bangemann probably ends .
i should just like to ask commissioner fischler one question : how long is the transition phase ?
why did mr delors not come forward to protect and defend the commission ?
takes guard against the privatization of social risks , especially with regard to health ' .
it requires clearly defined marking , and not least it requires information as to what the markings mean .
i hope to have answered all the questions .
both sides are waging the political struggle remorselessly and it has been going on for years now .
european-level regulation of mortgage credit would therefore mean approximating the security and application rules at the same time , hence ultimately the eu-wide harmonization of national property law provisions .
i regret that , but , as you all know , the deadline of 1 january next year is putting pressure on us all .
if we require it to bear the additional burden of the social policy , we will be hounding more and more jobs out of europe .
we considered whether we should go on waiting for the directive , which is impossible in view of the date and the legal basis we are creating for national regulations , or whether we should accept a compromise .
it is sensible to strengthen consumer rights and interests in the area of financial services , banks and insurance services for example .
this issue is so grave that it is hard to understand how something like this could have happened in the european union .
chad
finally , the commission has also exerted pressure to have a clause inserted in the treaty , at the intergovernmental conference , prohibiting any form of racial discrimination .
we should also pay increasing attention - just as the rapporteur properly pointed out - to the interrelation between short , medium and long term types of aid , through a duly coherent approach .
in fact , the official journal has already published the commission 's regulation on the certificates that importers must hand over to the community 's customs authorities before furs can be imported .
that is why we are calling for guarantees for our citizens - it is clear that the tightening of security must not be used as a pretext to restrict their freedom !
after all the attention given to the electronic highway , the focusing of attention on the social aspects brought a breathing space .
it is not true , ladies and gentlemen , because there are no obsolete industries ; there are obsolete technologies .
we are voting for the report .
but of course we can define the conditions under which such an industry can operate more clearly than in the past .
the rapporteur has presented an excellent report .
information technology is only a support .
what is the commission doing to utilize phare programme funds more efficiently in the important preparatory stage ?
question no 22 by mr gallagher ( h-0181 / 97 )
thousands of kilometres away the fraudster is able to hoodwink the system , and this has been happening .
the work done by the committee of inquiry , which sheds so much light on the situation and provides strong political impetus , will be of great help when it comes to translating these initiatives into action .
i believe we can help the population more effectively in that way than by merely appearing as firefighters whenever there is a crisis .
those agreements are a source of employment for a very large number of structurally sensitive maritime regions .
i would therefore like to offer my thanks for your collaboration on this specific aspect .
i cannot vote in favour of this resolution because of the paragraphs on reinforced co-operation .
i could in fact have cut you off pursuant to rule 47 , mr pirker , because you were not speaking on the subject , but engaging in a discussion of principle .
now , the matter of women and the problematical situation of women in afghanistan .
now , three points related to this subject : a number of measures have been taken in connection with the specific subject of trade in human beings for the purposes of sexual exploitation .
1997 is a year of major steps towards nuclear disarmament .
today , we are disappointed .
and yet gmos are not the panacea of agricultural development !
therefore i do not think that a number of you have been completely accurate today when you state that we did not take account of the fact that many member states were against the recommendation to approve this maize .
and it is not very polite to interrupt a colleague while he is speaking .
the notion of community financial assistance - that is the treaty 's expression - does not , indeed , exclude genuine budgetary interventions .
i must stress that for this process to be successful it must be inclusive .
masses and dimensions of motor vehicles
next , there is the underspend of the appropriations : some 20 % for the structural funds and 24 % for the european social fund , in particular .
i think that the report is excellent and it is good that three individual issues have been raised as tangible examples so that everyone may understand what this is about .
it is not easy in the commission but you know as well as i do that it will not be easy in parliament either .
that applies more particularly today , at a time when a gradual increase in tensions and difficulties is threatening to sweep us off course .
the commissioner was correct when he said that the crisis is political .
the irish presidency presented a compromise text on this at the council meeting of december last .
that broke the partnership , and the result of the broken partnership lies before you : a boring auto-oil concept that leads nowhere .
even so , we do agree with the objectives of fiorella ghilardotti 's report .
this will allow plenty of time for your amendments to be fully considered .
likewise the viewpoints of the scientists can change if they get together with the fishermen and find out that they are not all baddies , intent on destroying stocks .
the commission accepts the following amendments : no 1 as a recital and nos .
but , in a more general way , these obstacles result from the fact that the way of thinking in the sphere of academic recognition still prevails .
one of these instruments is precisely , within the framework of social protocol , social dialogue .
not at all !
it goes without saying that child pornography and racist material are outrageous . but a cross-border medium like the internet requires cross-border legislation , starting at the european level .
perhaps because it is starved of fuel , because the council refuses to free up enough funds for the various sme programmes . but that is not the main reason .
the committee supports the principle of today 's working party with regard to future maritime systems and strongly urges that this be extended to the fifth framework programme as well .
we know that driftnet fishing is unacceptable in the way that the catch of dolphins and turtles etc. is not to be recommended .
that speech may have been written yesterday , i do not know ; but it seems to me as if we are being treated as a rubber stamp .
the green paper addresses only the aspect of unauthorized reception of encrypted services .
our aim should therefore be to ensure that organic feeds are in fact used exclusively , with a suitable transition period .
it is a shame that it has taken so long to appear but , as they say , ' better late than never ' .
for example , not enough attention has been paid to the eu 's northern dimension .
at the same time , regulation no 2078 of 1992 on environmentally compatible agricultural production methods adapted to the landscape has also contributed substantially to this trend .
it will be possible to wage information society wars by means of the networks .
i am going to be asking you to be very dynamic and very cooperative .
these difficulties were all identified years ago but there seems there has been no way of solving them so far .
that is racism .
mr president , the two reports which have been discussed here this morning should set alarm bells ringing for most european citizens .
the truth is that our joint actions are unimpressive .
another factor also has to be borne in mind : there have as yet been relatively few rulings under the new procedure .
shortly after this meeting , mr kabila announced that the capital , kinshasa , would be taken by force if president mobutu did not resign within a week .
but even the safest power station is manned by people .
this objective unfortunately does not exert sufficient pressure to give priority to developing renewable sources of energy .
this has to be said quite plainly here .
this is highlighted by the ongoing concern in relation to the safety of nuclear installations , including sellafield , to which many people have referred during the earlier debate .
i am , therefore , against nuclear power practised in this way without any nuance .
lastly , we are angered by the provocative stance of the sudanese government vis à vis the repeated warnings by the international community , and in particular security council resolution 1070 of 16 august 1996 .
he has already spent 28 months in prison under very unpleasant conditions , with serious consequences for his physical and mental health .
whereas solar energy could be a solution in one region it is less viable in another , where perhaps water power or bio- energy would be more appropriate .
and what do we have here ?
we in the committee on budgets consider that this would be impossible to implement and would set an unacceptable precedent .
our citizens are demanding rights .
certainly this was a programme which brought great benefits in its day but these loans are less relevant now than they were .
secondly , the eurodac system is about the possibility of taking fingerprints in the case of asylum-seekers and has to do with the implementation of the dublin convention .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , parliament finds the proposal which is before us today to be very positive , commissioner .
let me conclude by asking the commissioner to tell us a little more in his address about other measures he is prepared to propose with the aim of further increasing safety on ferries .
mr president , my report also concerns agriculture , bee-keeping to be precise .
